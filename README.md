JS Tooling
===================================
![Assignment Checks](https://github.com/IT3049C-Summer20/3-rock-paper-scissors-<draginoff>/workflows/Assignment%20Checks/badge.svg)

Instructions to this assignment can be found [here](https://it3049c.github.io/docs/labs/tooling/).

## Checklist:
- [ ] update the assignment checks above to the correct link.
- [ ] make sure the assignment checks pass
- [X] fill out the self evaluation and Reflection
- [X] submit the repository link on Canvas

## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: 
  I feel i should get a 7/10 due to one of the checks not passing, not knowing how to create my own test, and I am unsure if the link was updated correctly. I think a 7/10 is reasonable for the amount of tests that passed and that if you do nothing and submit the reflection you will get a 50%
## Self-Reflection:
This assignment did not go well for me as I was quite lost on many of the parts where I had to solve the issues on my own, as well as many of the installation commands failed when I ran them.

### How long it took me to finish this?
I worked on this for about 6.5 hours
